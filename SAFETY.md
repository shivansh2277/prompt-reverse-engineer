# Safety & Responsible Use

## Limitations of Prompt Reconstruction
- Prompt reconstruction is probabilistic and heuristic-based.
- Outputs should be treated as best-effort estimates, not exact prompt recovery.
- Different prompts can produce similar outputs; ambiguity is expected.

## Non-Determinism Disclaimer
- While deterministic mode and seed controls are provided, upstream runtime differences can still affect outcomes in some deployments.
- Cached responses may differ from fresh responses if configuration changes across deployments.

## Misuse Warning
- Do not use this agent to reverse-engineer private, confidential, or proprietary prompts without authorization.
- Do not use results for policy evasion, social engineering, or jailbreak development.
- Follow platform terms, privacy regulations, and applicable law.
